				The <strong>raven paradox</strong>, also known as <strong>Hempel's paradox</strong>, <strong>Hempel's ravens</strong>, or <strong>paradox of indoor ornithology</strong>, is a <em>paradox</em> arising from the question of what constitutes <em>evidence</em> for a statement.
				<br>
				Observing objects that are neither <em>black</em> nor <em>ravens</em> may formally increase the likelihood that <em>all ravens are black</em> even though, intuitively, these observations are unrelated.
				<br>
				This problem was proposed by the logician Carl Gustav Hempel in the 1940s to illustrate a contradiction between <em>inductive logic</em> and <em>intuition</em>.

				<hr>
				Hempel describes the paradox in terms of the <em>hypothesis</em>:
				<br>
				(1) <strong><em>All ravens are black</em>. In the form of an implication, this can be expressed as: <em>If something is a raven, then it is black</em>.</strong>
				<br>
				Via <em>contraposition</em>, this statement is <em>equivalent</em> to:
				<br>
				(2) <strong><em>If something is not black, then it is not a raven</em>.</strong>
				<br>
				In all circumstances where (2) is true, (1) is also true—and likewise, in all circumstances where (2) is false (i.e., if a world is imagined in which something that was not black, yet was a raven, existed), (1) is also false.
				<br>
				Given a general statement such as all ravens are black, a form of the same statement that refers to a specific observable instance of the general class would typically be considered to constitute evidence for that general statement. For example,
				<br>
				(3) <strong><em>My pet raven is black</em>.</strong>
				<br>
				is evidence supporting the hypothesis that all ravens are black.
				<br>
				The paradox arises when this same process is applied to statement (2). On sighting a green apple, one can observe:
				<br>
				(4) <strong><em>This green apple is not black, and it is not a raven</em>.</strong>
				<br>
				By the same reasoning, this statement is evidence that (2) if something is not black then it is not a raven. 
				But since (as above) this statement is logically equivalent to (1) all ravens are black, it follows that the sight of a green apple is evidence supporting the notion that all ravens are black. 
				This conclusion seems paradoxical because it implies that information has been gained about ravens by looking at an apple.
				<h2 id="Proposed resolutions">
					Proposed resolutions
				</h2>
				<hr>
				Nicod's criterion says that only observations of <em>ravens</em> should affect one's view as to whether <em>all ravens are black</em>. 
				Observing more instances of <em>black ravens</em> should <em>support</em> the view, observing <em>white or coloured ravens</em> should <em>contradict</em> it, and observations of <em>non-ravens</em> <em>should not have any influence</em>.
				<br>
				Hempel's equivalence condition states that when a proposition, X, provides evidence in favor of another proposition Y, then X also provides evidence in favor of any proposition that is logically equivalent to Y.
				<br>
				Realistically, the set of ravens is finite. The set of non-black things is either infinite or beyond human enumeration. 
				To confirm the statement 'All ravens are black', it would be necessary to observe all ravens. This is difficult but possible. To confirm the statement 'All non-black things are non-ravens', it would be necessary to examine all non-black things. 
				This is not possible. Observing a black raven could be considered a finite amount of confirmatory evidence, but observing a non-black non-raven would be an infinitesimal amount of evidence.
				<br>
				The paradox shows that Nicod's criterion and Hempel's equivalence condition are not mutually consistent. A resolution to the paradox must reject at least one out of:
				<ol>
					<li>negative instances having no influence (!PC),</li>
					<li>equivalence condition (EC), or,</li>
					<li>validation by positive instances (NC).</li>
				</ol>
				A satisfactory resolution should also explain why there naively appears to be a paradox. 
				Solutions that accept the paradoxical conclusion can do this by presenting a proposition that we intuitively know to be false but that is easily confused with (PC), while solutions that reject (EC) or (NC) should present a proposition that we intuitively know to be true but that is easily confused with (EC) or (NC).
				<h3 id="Accepting non-ravens as relevant">

				Although this conclusion of the paradox seems counter-intuitive, some approaches accept that observations of (coloured) non-ravens can in fact constitute valid evidence in support for hypotheses about (the universal blackness of) ravens.
				<h4 id="Hempel's resolution">
					Hempel's resolution
				</h4>
				Hempel himself accepted the paradoxical conclusion, arguing that the reason the result appears paradoxical is that we possess prior information without which the observation of a non-black non-raven would indeed provide evidence that all ravens are black.
				<br>
				He illustrates this with the example of the generalization "All sodium salts burn yellow," and asks us to consider the observation that occurs when somebody holds a piece of pure ice in a colorless flame that does not turn yellow:
				<br>
				This result would confirm the assertion, "Whatever does not burn yellow is not sodium salt," and consequently, by virtue of the equivalence condition, it would confirm the original formulation. 
				Why does this impress us as paradoxical? The reason becomes clear when we compare the previous situation with the case of an experiment where an object whose chemical constitution is as yet unknown to us is held into a flame and fails to turn it yellow, and where subsequent analysis reveals it to contain no sodium salt. 
				This outcome, we should no doubt agree, is what was to be expected on the basis of the hypothesis ... thus the data here obtained constitute confirming evidence for the hypothesis. ...
				<br>
				In the seemingly paradoxical cases of confirmation, we are often not actually judging the relation of the given evidence, E alone to the hypothesis H ... 
				we tacitly introduce a comparison of H with a body of evidence which consists of E in conjunction with an additional amount of information which we happen to have at our disposal; in our illustration, this information includes the knowledge (1) that the substance used in the experiment is ice, and (2) that ice contains no sodium salt. If we assume this additional information as given, then, of course, the outcome of the experiment can add no strength to the hypothesis under consideration. 
				But if we are careful to avoid this tacit reference to additional knowledge ... the paradoxes vanish.

				One of the most popular proposed resolutions is to accept the conclusion that the observation of a green apple provides evidence that all ravens are black but to argue that the amount of confirmation provided is very small, due to the large discrepancy between the number of ravens and the number of non-black objects. 
				According to this resolution, the conclusion appears paradoxical because we intuitively estimate the amount of evidence provided by the observation of a green apple to be zero, when it is in fact non-zero but extremely small.
				<h4 id="Carnap approach">

				Maher accepts the paradoxical conclusion, and refines it:
				<br>
				A non-raven (of whatever color) confirms that all ravens are black because
				<br>
				(i) <strong>the information that this object is not a raven removes the possibility that this object is a counterexample to the generalization, and</strong>
				<br>
				(ii) <strong>it reduces the probability that unobserved objects are ravens, thereby reducing the probability that they are counterexamples to the generalization.</strong>
				<h4 id="Role of background knowledge">
					Role of background knowledge
				</h4>
				Much of the discussion of the paradox in general and the Bayesian approach in particular has centred on the relevance of background knowledge. Surprisingly, Maher shows that, for a large class of possible configurations of background knowledge, the observation of a non-black non-raven provides exactly the same amount of confirmation as the observation of a black raven. 
				The configurations of background knowledge that he considers are those that are provided by a sample proposition, namely a proposition that is a conjunction of atomic propositions, each of which ascribes a single predicate to a single individual, with no two atomic propositions involving the same individual. 
				Thus, a proposition of the form "A is a black raven and B is a white shoe" can be considered a sample proposition by taking "black raven" and "white shoe" to be predicates.

				Some approaches for resolving the paradox focus on the inductive step. 
				They dispute whether observation of a particular instance (such as one black raven) is the kind of evidence that necessarily increases confidence in the general hypothesis (such as that ravens are always black).
